1.1)	Project id, person_name(select company_name = “BigBank”(works))
1.2)	Project id, person_name, city(select employee.id = works.id /\ works.company_name = “BigBank”(employee x works))
1.3)	Project id, person_name, street, city(select employee.id = works.id /\ works.company_name = “BigBank” /\ works.salary > 10000(employee x works))
1.4)	Project id, person_name(select employee.city = company.city /\ employee.id = works.id /\ works.company_name = company.company_name(employee x works x company))

2.1) Project id, person_name(select company_name != “BigBank”(works))
